Dot Product: Added "Kids" that you pick up and save before you leave. There are 4.
You can't leave unless you collect all 4. The dot product is used so that the kids always face the player.
         
Particle Effect: Added particle effects for picking up "Kids" and when the game ends. When the game ends to an enemy, the player emits a red particle. When the game ends with the player reaching the end, the player emits a green particle.
Particle Source: Default Unity Particles.
    
Sound effect: Added sound effects to the start of the game and for collecting pickups.
